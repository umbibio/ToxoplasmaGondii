# Toxoplasma Transcriptional Program Analysis

This page provide instructions for running statistical analysis on preprocessed RNA-Seq lab-adaptation data of toxoplasmaGondii. The analysis are as follows:

* Differential Gene Expression Analysis
* Mixed-effect Regression Analysis
* Enrichment Analysis
* Clustering Analysis
* Life Stage Analysis

# Running the code

To install the code please clone the library by copy pasting the following in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/umbibio/ToxoplasmaGondii.git

Then navigate into the directory ```ToxoplasmaGondii``` to access the code and the required data.
# Data Availability

Aligned RNA-Seq read counts for each sample (generated by featureCount) are available at [here](https://markov.math.umb.edu/rnaseq_counts_toxoplasma/rnaseq_counts_toxo.zip). Other data required to run each analysis are provided in the input folder.
